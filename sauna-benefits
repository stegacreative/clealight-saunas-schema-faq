      "text": "Yes, infrared saunas have been shown to detoxify the human body from certain chemicals, toxins and heavy metals. The potential sauna benefits for detoxification in particular offer tremendous advantages for this purpose because of their ability to help fortify the lymphatic system—the primary organ working to rid the body of toxic waste and bacteria.

A study conducted in 2012 concluded that, after being exposed to toxins related to police work and other environmental factors, policemen recorded significantly improved post-treatment scores when taking regular infrared sauna sessions within a 4-6 week period. Thus, there is no doubt that saunas of all kinds provide fantastic opportunities to help detoxify your body."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Infrared Saunas remove toxins from the body in multiple ways. Firstly, sauna bathing causes increased blood circulation to occur to all parts of the body including the skin, muscles and joints. The increased blood flow carries any waste material from these areas back through the natural detoxification pathways - the liver, kidneys and lymphatic system.

Secondly, the heat stress from high temperatures causes you to sweat. As the skin temperature and body temperature rise, the body cools itself with sweat, a liquid made up of predominant water, but also fats, salts and toxins.

Lastly, infrared wavelengths cause fat cells to vibrate and essentially melt, resulting in a release of heavy metals and toxins that the body stores in the fat to protect itself from high toxin loads. This additional bonus of melting fat cells allows for an improved release of toxins typically unavailable from other means."

If you’re a new user, it’s advised you should limit your time inside the sauna to around 15-20 minutes, while monitoring your body for any adverse effects. If you’re a seasoned user of infrared saunas, you can extend this timeframe to around 30-45 minutes."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Infrared saunas are best for detoxification. Traditional saunas and steam saunas are limited in the process of detoxification because they do not target fat cells to release toxins and heavy metals as infrared saunas do.

The process of detoxing your body is far more than simply sweating out the toxins. While using an infrared sauna, the user benefits from a targeted detoxification process that allows infrared energy to break down toxins that would have otherwise gone unnoticed. The added energy from the infrared sauna gives your body’s lymphatic system the boost of nutrients and blood circulation filled with beneficial white-blood cells that get to work processing the toxins. Used in conjunction with regular exercise and a balanced diet will provide the best detoxification results."

      "text": "Yes. sauna bathing has proven to be relaxing. While this is no doubt subjective, it seems reasonable to assume that for most sauna use, the experience is a relaxing one. The sauna experience is relaxing in its initial stages, as your core body temperature slowly rises and promotes a number of health benefits. The heat gradually builds, though how long and at what intensity varies from person to person. The experience of sitting inside an infrared sauna has been overwhelmingly positive, according to feedback from our users."

      "text": "The Mayo Clinic recommends that learning to identify the root causes of stress, as well as creating self-care strategies to deal with the signs of stress is one of the best ways to combat stress and live a healthier life.

We believe that taking time out of your busy life to immerse yourself inside an infrared sauna is helpful in combating stress for two primary reasons.

The physiological sauna health benefits are well documented from peer-reviewed medical evidence. One of the major recommendations for minimising stress is to exercise, and sauna bathing triggers our bodies into a state very similar to a workout. If a sauna session is added to the end of a workout, these benefits stand to be magnified.
Meditation is taken to a whole new level when it comes to sauna use. That relaxation of the body, mind and soul allows for deeper breathing which helps reduce cortisol levels in the body and increase circulation, resulting in more oxygenated blood for a healthier life. Many experienced sauna users are well aware of the relaxation stages one should be in before being able to practise meditation inside a sauna and benefit from these relaxation practices. They also inhabit much higher health reaching peaks sometimes unattainable without relaxation associated with a sauna session."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "When we are exposed to one or many sources of personal stress, our bodies release a hormone known as cortisol into the blood, which acts as a wake-up call for our body to respond to a potentially threatening situation. Elevated cortisol increases your pulse and blood pressure, and provides your brain with adrenaline and glucose to deal with these situations. It should be pointed out that short-term bursts of stress aren’t necessarily unhealthy, they’re actually an evolutionary reaction to keep ourselves safe from threats."

Sauna bathers that don't participate in regular dry sauna bathing should monitor their bodies for any adverse symptoms for a reduced risk. Sitting inside a sauna doesn’t necessarily guarantee relaxation, so if you’re feeling as though your body is giving you warning signs to step out before you hit the 25-minute mark, listen to these signs and step outside."

    "acceptedAnswer": {
      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "Yes, infrared saunas benefits arthritis symptoms and joint pain. This is because sauna bathing can boost oxygen-rich blood flow, providing relief from pain in problem areas. Mitochondria (cellular ‘powerhouses’) are charged up by infrared energy and ATP receives a power boost. This sends nutrient-rich blood to the cells, particularly beneficial for those with arthritis. It’s important to note from the outset that the use of infrared saunas, in isolation, should not be considered a cure for arthritis. Instead, we should think of it as a simple, convenient, and relaxing means of treating the symptoms of arthritis, like chronic pain and joint stiffness. 

A pilot study from Clinical Rheumatology found that there was a “significant” impact on the short-term improvement of pain and stiffness in sufferers of arthritis, with the authors noting a “trend towards long-term beneficial effects” of infrared sauna use for these patients, as well as the fact that sauna bathing has had “no adverse effects” for the users. They also pointed out that their results indicated that “fatigue also decreased” in their patients."

      "@type": "Answer",
      "text": "For muscle recovery, you should aim for 15-20 minutes for new sauna bathers and more experienced users can stretch to 30-45 minutes for optimal results. Exercising breaks down muscle fibres that rebuild over a 24-48 hour period, causing the majority of muscle pain. Inflammation is a vital part of the body's defence mechanism and is necessary for maintaining health. It is a response to injury or infection and involves an increase in blood flow to the affected area, as well as the release of immune cells and proteins that help fight off foreign invaders. Sauna bathing can help with muscle recovery and repair, as the process involves inflammation that increases blood flow to the affected area. The duration and intensity of a sauna session should be monitored to ensure optimal results for both new and experienced users."

This increased blood flow then helps to treat inflammation, as well as strengthen the body's immune system for future protection. Overall, it is clear that inflammation plays an important role in maintaining health and fighting off foreign invaders. However, it is also important to recognise that uncontrolled inflammation can lead to long-term changes in gene expression which may result in chronic diseases if left unchecked."

      "text": "Yes, saunas burn calories. Sauna bathing raises the body's core temperature and the body regulates this by lowering the skin temperature through sweating, resulting in the body using energy and burning calories to do so. 

A two-phase study from Binghamton University in New York shows that people who used a sauna three times a week were able to reduce their body fat index by 4% over a four-month period. Researchers noted that users did not change their exercise or diet during the study, and their control group - who did not partake in sauna use - showed no signs of losing weight. 

This led the researchers to conclude that regular sauna bathing can have a profound impact on the body’s metabolism and ability to burn calories in a short period of regular sauna usage."

This is dependent on the person’s level of health, and things like their weight and tolerance to heat in the first place, however, is the universally agreed-upon range of calorie loss. This means that without any real physical activity, you can almost double your body’s ability to metabolise calories - and as you’ll discover in a minute, fat - through the simple act of sitting in a sauna."

This allows your body to reach its optimal temperature without risking dehydration or other health issues. For those who are fit and healthy, sessions of up to 30-45 minutes may be beneficial.

For weight loss, regular sauna bathing at a frequency of at least 3 times a week is the minimum for optimal weight loss sauna benefits.

It is important to note that saunas should not be used as a substitute for regular exercise or a healthy diet; however, when combined with other lifestyle changes such as increased physical activity and eating healthier foods, they can help contribute to weight loss. Everyone's body is different so the amount of time spent in the sauna should be tailored accordingly."

Moisturising after your infrared sauna session can help with any potential skin irritation and provide nutrients to your skin. However, cosmetics clog the pores on your skin and will interfere with your body's ability to sweat. It is recommended to have clean skin before the sauna and you may apply cosmetics afterwards."
